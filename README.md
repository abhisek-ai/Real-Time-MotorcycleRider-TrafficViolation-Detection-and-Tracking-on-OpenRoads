# Real-Time-MotorcycleRider-TrafficViolation-Detection-and-Tracking-on-OpenRoads
* We proposed an approach for detecting, tracking, and counting motorcycle riding violations in videos taken from a vehicle-mounted dashboard camera. 
* We employed a curriculum learning-based object detector to better tackle challenging scenarios such as occlusions.
* We introduced a novel trapezium-shaped object boundary representation to increase robustness and tackle the rider-motorcycle association. 
* We also introduce an Amodal regressor that generates bounding boxes for the occluded riders.
