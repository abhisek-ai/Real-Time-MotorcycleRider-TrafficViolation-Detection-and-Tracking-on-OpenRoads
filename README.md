# Real-Time-MotorcycleRider-TrafficViolation-Detection-and-Tracking-on-OpenRoads
* Implemented detection and tracking system for motorcycle violations using dashboard camera videos, improving detection accuracy from 74% to 95% (representing a 28% improvement) 
* Integrated curriculum learning-based object detection to handle occlusions, enhancing tracking precision.
* Innovated with a novel trapezium-shaped boundary representation, increasing robustness in rider-motorcycle association and resulting in a 20% improvement in detection accuracy
* We also introduce an Amodal regressor that generates bounding boxes for the occluded riders.
